# MeMDLM: _De Novo_ Membrane Protein Design with Property-Guided Discrete Diffusion

Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs), introduced by Sahoo et al (arxiv.org/pdf/2406.07524), provide strong generative capabilities to BERT-style models. In this work, we pre-train and fine-tune ESM-2-150M on the MDLM objective to unconditionally generate realistic, high-quality membrane protein sequences.
